# Water-Level-Monitoring-System-
ðŸ’§ IoT-Enabled Water Level Monitoring System

Overview:
This project features an IoT-enabled Water Level Monitoring System designed to automate water pump operations and maintain consistent water levels. Built with the ESP8266, ultrasonic sensors, and a relay module, the system offers real-time monitoring and alerts through the Blynk platform.

Features
â¦¿ Automated Water Pump Control: Automatically operates the pump to maintain optimal water levels.
â¦¿ Real-Time Monitoring: View live water level data on the Blynk app.
â¦¿ Instant Alerts: Receive notifications when water levels are too high or low.
â¦¿ Precise Sensor Calibration: Ensures accurate measurements of water levels.
â¦¿ Seamless IoT Integration: Reliable and responsive connectivity for hassle-free operation.

Tech Stack
â¦¿ Microcontroller: ESP8266
â¦¿ Sensors: Ultrasonic sensors for water level measurement
â¦¿ Actuators: Relay module to control water pump
â¦¿ Platform: Blynk IoT for real-time data and alerts

Applications
â¦¿ Smart home water management
â¦¿ Water conservation in agriculture
â¦¿ Tank monitoring systems

How It Works
1.Ultrasonic sensors measure the water level in real time.
2.The ESP8266 processes the data and sends it to the Blynk IoT platform.
3.Based on the water level, the relay module automatically turns the water pump on or off.
4.Users receive updates and alerts via the Blynk mobile app.
